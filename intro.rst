Introduction
====================================================

SimX is a library for developing parallel, discrete-event simulations in Python. Written in C++ and Python, SimX enables rapid development of distributed-memory, parallel simulations in Python by providing the simulation modeler with core functionality such as processes, event queuing, time advancement, domain partitioning, synchronization and message passing. 

SimX has been designed for both ease-of-use and scalability; applications built using SimX can be executed on multi-core workstations or high performance clusters and can also be easily integrated with other Python tools for scientific computing.
